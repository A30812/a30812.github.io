# Risks and Challenges

## Deep Learning Models are opaque in their decision-making

Deep learning models, like those used in AI, are inherently opaque. Engineers may understand what the car sensed, and how the car responded, to a situation, but the actual decision-making occurs in a black box.

This is in sharp contrast to the state-based and deterministic automated systems we are accustomed to. When these types of systems fail a decision-making process, the failure can be identified, fixed and tested with a high degree of confidence. When a deep learning model fails, the answer is simply ‘more data’.

## Ethical dilemmas + the trolley problem

## Need for new infrastructure

## Need new legal framework

## Public Acceptance

## Transition Period

The transitory period when self-driving cars are first unleashed on public roads marks one of the greatest potential risk periods. At this time self-driving cars will be working from relatively small datasets of ‘real world’ scenarios and no amount of public messaging is going to ensure that every ‘Joe Public’ is going to respond to these new cars in a sensible manner.

“It takes a long time to turn over the U.S. fleet of light-duty vehicles, with the average vehicular age currently being 11.4 years (IHS, 2014). Therefore, there will likely be at least a several-decade-long period during which conventional and self-driving vehicles would need to interact.” (Sivak et al., 2015)

During this transition period, it is important to acknowledge the risks of the coexistence between self-driving cars and conventional vehicles, as safety may worsen. A quote from Sivak states “Furthermore, in many current situations, interacting drivers of conventional vehicles make eye contact and proceed according to the feedback received from other drivers. Such feedback would be absent in interactions with self-driving vehicles.” This is due to feedback bouncing off drivers on the road to make decisions are being eliminated due to self-driving cars.
