Proponents of the technology expound the virtues of the autonomous vehicle (AV).</p> <p>The key talking points are compelling: an ever-vigilante machine that reacts at the speed of thought makes humans seem like apes behind the wheel. For detractors, safety is the area of greatest concern. Deep learning models are fast, but they are brittle in novel situations, and we understand their decision-making processes even less than we understand our own. Recent advances in neural network mapping may give more insight into AI decision-making in future, but this is still far removed from the level of control we are accustomed to having over safety-critical automated systems.</p> <p>Since the public unveiling of the Google Self-driving Car project in 2010, now Waymo, investment has been thick and fast. Now, after over a decade of delays and setbacks self-driving technology is no longer on the horizon, the push for integration is happening now. In August 2022 the British government unveiled their plan for a wider rollout of self-driving vehicles by 2025, backed by a £100 million investment to “to support industry investment and fund research on safety developments.”</p> <p>New Zealand currently has such no roadmap, despite having both high car ownership and high car dependency. In the absence of government programs, usual factors such as physical isolation and a small market meant AV manufacturers had no incentive to even consider the country as a candidate testbed. However, the MOT issued a report in 2022 outlining possible impacts and as well as paths forward, and the NZTA is open to working with manufacturers interested in testing their vehicles in New Zealand.</p> <h2 id="sae-five-levels-of-automation"> <a href="#sae-five-levels-of-automation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="sae-five-levels-of-automation"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> SAE five levels of automation </h2> <p>The Society of Automated Vehicles International has defines five levels of automation, with a sixth level, zero, for unautomated vehicles. Levels 0-2 is categorised by features that support the driver, such as adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning. Even if the vehicle is controlling the acceleration, breaking, or steering of the vehicle, this classification considers that the human driver is still driving the vehicle. The classification considers the remaining three levels to be automated, and that a human in the driver’s seat is not driving whilst these features are active.</p> <p>At Level 3, the vehicle can drive itself, but the human driver must take over when prompted to. Whilst SAE international characterises this as a peer of more automated Levels 4 and 5, colloquially vehicles with these features are rarely considered to be ‘the self-driving car.’</p> <p>At Levels 4 and 5, vehicles can complete a trip without any driver input and are typically considered to be ‘self-driving’. Fifth level vehicles can drive themselves regardless of limitations that may be imposed on Fourth Level vehicles such as geo-fencing, poor visibility etc. Fifth level may be considered the ultimate goal of self-driving vehicle development.</p> <h2 id="how-does-it-work"> <a href="#how-does-it-work" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="how-does-it-work"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> How does it work? </h2> <p>The modern road environment is unpredictable and interpreting it is fundamental. To this end AVs are equipped with RADAR and LIDAR to map the depth of local environment. Camera-arrays provide a finer picture of the near environment and use parallax to judge distance which can be corroborated with range-finding sensors, and ultrasonic sensors for judging the distance to extremely close obstacles such as other cars and curbs. Inertial sensors (IMUs), odometers and GPS can judge the motion, pitch, yaw and roll of the vehicle in space independently. In the event other more precise, but more fragile, sensors be rendered inoperative the inertial sensors can also function as a failsafe to control the vehicle to a safe halt.</p> <p>This data is processed in real time by the OS to create a map of both the static environment, and dynamic objects within the environment. This map, or state, is combined with the vehicles state, and passed to the decision-making stack. The first stage of this stack is route planning, the vehicle generates waypoints to its destination based on the known road layout and any perceived changes. This is then passed to a behavioural layer which “reasons about the environment and generates a motion specification to progress along the selected route.”</p> <p>Using the motion specification and data about the vehicle’s orientation and local space, the motion layer then plans the vehicle’s manoeuvre as a path vector. Finally, the path vector and the vehicle’s current state is used by the local feedback control layer to generate individual inputs to the vehicle itself. (Paden et al, 2016)</p> <p>All four of these layers can be implemented using classical computer science solutions, such as A* for route planning, and a Finite State Machine or Markov Decision Processes for behaviour. However Deep Learning techniques such as Convoluted Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly well suited to some tasks such as image recognition and modelling spatial information.</p> </main> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
