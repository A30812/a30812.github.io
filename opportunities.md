# Opportunities

## Improve road safety

The improvements to road safety represents one of the brightest hopes of self-driving technology.

The WHO estimated that in 2018 the number of road fatalities for that year had reached 1.35 million.  It has become the leading cause of death for persons aged 5-29, and the 8th leading cause of death for all age groups, outpacing historical killers such as disease and famine.
Research into road accidents tends to place human error as a cause more than 90% of the time. This may represent a bias against human judgement. With any failure not attributable to mechanical failure or an unpredictable environment defaulting to ‘blame the driver.’ Despite this, human error is undoubtedly a significant contributor to road accident. Whilst Sweden leads the world in road safety, with Stockholm having the lowest fatality rates among the European capitals, its pioneering ‘Vision Zero’ approach has only managed to reduce its road toll by 66%, not 90%.

With tireless mind and superhuman senses, the AI driver seems the perfect candidate to close this gap. As an alternative to irresponsible behaviour such as driving while fatigued, distracted, intoxicated or under the effects of prescription or non-prescription drugs, self-driving cars will likely have the most to give. Resources that are currently invested into driver education and awareness campaigns would then be free to be reinvested into other avenues to improve road safety.

Even the model human driver, cautious and attentive, cannot escape the decay in skill that comes with age, and like all skills there are diminishing returns and increasing costs on further instruction to improve human driving ability. Inversely, new advances in AI software and hardware will may see self-driving cars continue to improve generationally, or even over the course of the life of the vehicle via software updates.
The first LASER cost as much as a small house , 40 years later the cheapest cost less than a dollar. It is conceivable that history may repeat, and sensors that are prohibitively expensive for autonomous systems now, may in future be cost-effective.

## Safety improvements for vehicular design

As the need to design cars around a human driver drops away, vehicular design may change to better accommodate existing or new needs, such as comfort or safety. Much of contemporary vehicle’s surface area is glass. This is a safety necessity for a human driver. With self-driving vehicles comes the need to externalise sensors. Once the human driver is disestablished from the vehicle’s design, glass becomes a safety risk rather than a safety necessity.

Whilst still “a dream” as Nilesh Barla writing for neptune.ai puts it, vehicle-to-vehicle networking is very much an avenue that will be explored as networking technologies and algorithms improve in accuracy and efficiency. Sensor fusion already used by cutting-edge militaries like the United States to provide a more complete picture of the battlespace to soldiers. Within civilian transport infrastructure it could be used to enhance an automated vehicle’s decision making and to shore up an individual vehicle’s view of its surrounding if part of its sensor suite becomes incapable of providing the system with useful data in the event of damage, interference, jamming or blinding.

## Protecting the most vulnerable road users

Cyclists and motorcyclists are severely represented in road accidents.
